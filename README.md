## Dinner Party

### Base Requirements
Create a command-line application which helps plan a dinner party. Create three arrays of `beverages`, `food`, and `people`. When your application runs it should randomly assign a beverage and a food item to each person. Print to the terminal a list of all of the people with their food and beverage along with a seat number.

### Optional Enhancements

- If you didn't already, only use one `Hash` variable which holds `beverages`, `food`, and `people` keys.
- Allow the application to ask for user input to populate the three arrays. The user should be allowed to put in as many items as they want into each array. The program will need some way to determine when a user is finished adding values for a particular array.
